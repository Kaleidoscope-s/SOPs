# Security Incident Response Plan

## Purpose
The purpose of this Security Incident Response Plan (SIRP) is to establish a framework for effectively detecting, responding to, and mitigating security incidents within the organization. This document outlines the standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed by the cybersecurity team when responding to security incidents. The plan includes detailed testing procedures for security controls and monitoring solutions, along with a diagram depicting the expected events when an attack triggers the monitoring tools.

## Scope
This plan applies to all systems, networks, and data owned or managed by the organization, regardless of location or ownership.

## Incident Categorization
Security incidents should be categorized based on their severity and impact. The following incident categories are defined:

a. Category 1: Critical Incidents

Incidents with severe impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability of critical systems or data.
Immediate response and escalation are required.

b. Category 2: Major Incidents

Incidents with significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems or data.
Prompt response and escalation are necessary.

c. Category 3: Minor Incidents

Incidents with minimal impact on systems or data.
Timely investigation and resolution are needed.
Incident Response Procedures
The incident response procedures should be followed in the event of a security incident:
a. Incident Detection and Reporting
i. Monitoring tools continuously monitor network traffic, system logs, and security event sources.
ii. When an incident is detected, the monitoring tools trigger alerts and generate notifications.
iii. Incident is reported to the incident response team through the designated reporting channels.

b. Initial Assessment and Classification
i. The incident response team assesses the initial information and classifies the incident into the appropriate category.
ii. The team determines the severity, scope, and potential impact of the incident.

c. Incident Response
i. The incident response team initiates a response plan specific to the incident category.
ii. Immediate containment measures are implemented to minimize further damage or unauthorized access.
iii. Relevant stakeholders are notified and involved as per the escalation process.
iv. Forensic evidence is collected and preserved for analysis.

d. Investigation and Analysis
i. The incident response team conducts a detailed investigation to identify the root cause, attack vectors, and compromised systems.
ii. Relevant logs, network traffic captures, and system snapshots are collected for analysis.
iii. External support, such as law enforcement or third-party incident response providers, may be engaged if necessary.

e. Incident Mitigation and Recovery
i. The team develops and executes a plan to mitigate the impact of the incident.
ii. Compromised systems are isolated, patched, or restored from clean backups.
iii. Security controls and configurations are reviewed and updated to prevent similar incidents in the future.

f. Lessons Learned and Documentation
i. After the incident is resolved, a post-incident review is conducted to document lessons learned and identify areas for improvement.
ii. Incident response procedures, security controls, and monitoring solutions are updated based on the lessons learned.

## Testing Procedures and Expected Outcomes
To ensure the effectiveness of security controls and monitoring solutions, regular testing procedures should be conducted. The following steps are involved:
a. Define Testing Scenarios
i. Identify potential attack vectors and security weaknesses.
ii. Develop testing scenarios that simulate realistic attack scenarios.

b. Execute Testing Procedures
i. Conduct penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, or red teaming exercises.
ii. Test the response of security controls and monitoring solutions to various attack scenarios.

c. Assess and Analyze Results
i. Evaluate the effectiveness of security controls and monitoring solutions
